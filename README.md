Calendar App
This project is a simple calendar web application built using Python Django for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete events on their personal calendar. The app also supports user authentication and includes a REST API for interacting with calendar events.

•	User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and logout functionality.
•	Event Management: Users can create, view, edit, and delete events on their personal calendar.
•	Calendar View: A clean, intuitive interface to display events in a monthly, weekly, or daily view.
•	REST API: Exposes calendar functionalities through a REST API for potential integration with other services or apps.
•	Responsive Design: Works across multiple device types (desktop, mobile, tablet).
